Abstract
========

This REP defines target platforms for each ROS Distribution Release.
We define platforms to include both operating system releases (Ubuntu
Lucid) as well as major language releases (e.g. Python 2.5). The
target platforms represent the set on which all stable, released
stacks are expected to work. Exceptions can be made for stacks that are
intentionally platform-specific.

Motivation
==========

This document is provided to help plan future development for
libraries. The primary platforms for ROS are Canonical's Ubuntu
releases, and our intent is to track these releases as best as
possible while also allowing for current, thirdparty libraries to be
used.

Rationale
=========

Target platforms for future releases are speculative and are based on
consulting Ubuntu's release and end-of-life schedule [1]_. 

We generally expect to use the ROS Distribution release prior to an
Ubuntu LTS release to transition to newer libraries and drop support
for older platforms. Our past experience with Ubuntu releases is that
the release prior to an LTS release (e.g. Karmic) incorporates major
jumps in library versions; also, this release is generally very
similar to the LTS release. Requiring that all stacks be compatible
across a wide spread of Ubuntu releases can be very difficult,
especially for libraries like Boost that do not provide for backwards
compatibility.

Our intent with Python support is to track the minimum Python version
provided in the supported Ubuntu platforms, as well as survey other
commonly used OS platforms that support ROS to determine a reasonable
minimum target. There is currently no plan to jump to Python 3k.

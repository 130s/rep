Abstract
========

This REP specifies naming conventions and semantic meaning for
coordinate frames of mobile platforms used with ROS.


Motivation
==========

Developers of drivers, models, and libraries need a share convention
for coordinate frames in order to better integrate and re-use software
components. Shared conventions for coordinate frames provides a
specification for developers creating drivers and models for mobile
bases. Similarly, developers creating libraries and applications can
more easily use their software with a variety of mobile bases that are
compatible with this specification. For example, this REP specifies
the frames necessary for writing a new localization component. It also
specifies frames that can be used to refer to the mobile base of a
robot.


Specification
=============

Coordinate Frames
-----------------

map
'''

The coordinate frame called ``map`` is a world fixed frame, with its
Z-axis pointing upwards. The pose of a mobile platform, relative to
the ``map`` frame, should not significantly drift over time. The
``map`` frame is not continuous, meaning the pose of a mobile platform
in the ``map`` frame can change in discrete jumps at any time.

In a typical setup, a localization component constantly re-computes
the robot pose in the ``map`` frame based on sensor observations,
therefore eliminating drift, but causing discrete jumps when new
sensor information arrives.

The ``map`` frame is useful as a long-term global reference, but
discrete jumps make it a poor reference frame for local sensing and
acting.

It is recommended to align the map with east, north, up (ENU) as a default for consisent viewing, but is not required.
Reasons to choose other orientations might include local geographic feature alignment, or consistency with a prior map, or other application specific requirements.
If the map is being constructed dynamically (SLAM) and absolute heading is unknown it is recommended to take a best estimate of NEU with at least up being as accurately aligned as possible.

odom
''''

The coordinate frame called ``odom`` is a world-fixed frame. The pose
of a mobile platform in the ``odom`` frame can drift over time,
without any bounds. This drift makes the ``odom`` frame useless as a
long-term global reference. However, the pose of a robot in the
``odom`` frame is guaranteed to be continuous, meaning that the pose
of a mobile platform in the ``odom`` frame always evolves in a smooth
way, without discrete jumps.

In a typical setup the ``odom`` frame is computed based on an odometry
source, such as wheel odometry, visual odometry or an inertia
measurement unit.

The ``odom`` frame is useful as an accurate, short-term local
reference, but drift makes it a poor frame for long-term reference.


base_link
'''''''''

The coordinate frame called ``base_link`` is rigidly attached to the
mobile robot base. The ``base_link`` can be attached to the base in
any arbitrary position or orientation; for every hardware platform
there will be a different place on the base that provides an obvious
point of reference. Note that REP 103 [1]_ specifies a preferred
orientation for frames.

earth
'''''

The coordinate frame called ``earth`` is the origin of ECEF.

This frame is designed to allow the interaction of multiple robots in different map frames.
If the application only needs one map the ``earth`` coordinate frame is not expected to be present.
In the case of running with multiple maps simultaneously the ``map`` and ``odom`` and ``base_link`` frames will need to be customized for each robot.
If running multiple robots and bridging data between them, the transform frame_ids can remain standard on each robot if the other robots_frame_ids are rewritten.

If the ``map`` frame is globally referenced the publisher from ``earth`` to ``map`` can be a static transform publisher.
Otherwise the ``earth`` to ``map`` transform will usually need to be computed by taking the estimate of the current global position and subtracting the current estimated pose in the map to get the estimated pose of the origin of the map.

In case the ``map`` frame's absolute positon is unknown at the time of startup, it can remain detached until such time that the global position estimation can be adaquately evaluated.
This will operate in the same way that a robot can operate in the ``odom`` frame before localization in the ``map`` frame is innitialized.

Relationship between Frames
---------------------------

We have chosen a tree representation to attach all coordinate frames
in a robot system to each other. Therefore each coordinate frame has
one parent coordinate frame, and any number of child coordinate
frames. The frames described in this REP are attached as follows:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="mermaid" style="font-family:'Lucida Console', monospace">
  %% Example diagram
  graph LR
      O(odom) --> B(base_link)
      M(map) --> O
      E(earth) --> M

  </div>


The ``map`` frame is the parent of ``odom``, and ``odom`` is the
parent of ``base_link``.  Although intuition would say that both
``map`` and ``odom`` should be attached to ``base_link``, this is not
allowed because each frame can only have one parent.


Example of multi-robot tf graph using ECEF
------------------------------------------


.. raw:: html

  <div class="mermaid" style="font-family:'Lucida Console', monospace">
  %% Example diagram
  graph TB
      odom_1(odom_1) --> base_link1(base_link1)
      map_1(map_1) --> odom_1
      earth(earth) --> map_1
      odom_2(odom_2) --> base_link2(base_link2)
      map_2(map_2) --> odom_2
      earth --> map_2
  </div>

This is an example of a tf tree with two robots using different maps for localization and having a common frame ``earth``.

The diagram above uses different frame ids for clarity.
However for maximum reusability it is recommended to use the canonical frame ids on each robot and use a script to forward information off of the robot.
When the information is forwarded the frame ids should be remapped to disambiguate which robot they are coming from and referencing.



Frame Authorities
-----------------

The transform from ``odom`` to ``base_link`` is computed and broadcast
by one of the odometry sources.

The transform from ``map`` to ``base_link`` is computed by a
localization component. However, the localization component does not
broadcast the transform from ``map`` to ``base_link``. Instead, it
first receives the transform from ``odom`` to ``base_link``, and uses
this information to broadcast the transform from ``map`` to ``odom``.

The transform from ``earth`` to ``map`` is statically published and
configured by the choice of map frame. If not specifically configured
a fallback position is to use the initial position of the vehicle as
the origin of the map frame.
If the map is not georeferenced so as to support a simple static transform the localization module can follow the same procedure as for publishing the estimated offset from the ``map` to the ``odom`` frame to publish the transform from ``earth`` to ``map`` frame.


Exceptions
----------

The scope of potential robotics software is too broad to require all
ROS software to follow the guidelines of this REP.  However, choosing
different conventions should be well justified and well documented.

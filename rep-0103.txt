Abstract
========

This REP provides a reference for the units and coordinate conventions
used withing ROS.


Rationale
=========

If developers use different units and conventions whenever code
interacts with different conventions compatibility must be tested and
converted to the preferred conventions of the other interface.  However if all
nodes use the same conventions these checks can be avoided.  This
saves time, computation, and complexity, all of which make it easier
to write reliable readable code.

Exceptions
==========

There are domains where the default conventions are not appropriate.
An example is that interstellar lengths are not appropriately measured
in meters.  In these cases choosing a different unit is valid.
However make sure to clearly document the non standard convention
usage.

Adhearing to this REP is not required.  However choosing a different
conventions should be justified by a measurable gain during an API
review.

Units
=====

When using units we have chosen to standardize on SI units.  These
units are the most consistent international standard.  

These units are maintained by Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. [1]_
There is good documentation on Wikipedia for `International System Of Units`_

.. _International System of Units: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units

Base Units
----------
These are the base units which are commonly used

=======  ========
Quanity  Unit
=======  ========
length   meter
mass     kilogram
time     second
current  ampere
=======  ========

Derived Units
-------------\

SI defines 7 base units and many derived units.  If you are not using
SI base units you should use SI derived units.

Good documentation can be found on Wikipedia about `SI derived units`_

Commonly used SI derived units in ROS are:

===========   =======
Quanity       Unit
===========   =======
angle         radian
frequency     hertz
force         newton
power         watt
voltage       volt
temperature   celsius
===========   =======

Coordinate Frame Conventions
============================

For standardization and communication all coordinate frames should follow these convetions.  

Chirality
---------

All systems are right handed.  This means they comply with the `right hand rule`_

.. _right hand rule: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule


Axis Orientation
----------------
In relation to a body the standard is 

* x forward
* y left
* z up

Orientation of frames with optical in the name with respect to the camera.

* z forward
* x right
* y down



Rotation Representation
-----------------------
There are many ways to represent rotations the order of preference is listed below with the primary reasons.

1. quaternion

  * Compact representation
  * No singularities

2. rotation matrix

  * No singularities

3. fixed axis roll, pitch, yaw about X, Y, Z axes respectivly

  * No ambiguity on order
  * Used for angular velocities

4. euler angles yaw, pitch, and roll about Z, Y, X axes respectivly

Covariance Representation
-------------------------
Linear
::

    float64[9] linear_acceleration_covariance # 3x3 row major matrix in x, y z order

Angular

::

    float64[9] angular_velocity_covariance # 3x3 row major matrix about x, y, z order with fixed axes

Six Dimensional

::

    # Row-major representation of the 6x6 covariance matrix
    # The orientation parameters use a fixed-axis representation.
    # In order, the parameters are:
    # (x, y, z, rotation about X axis, rotation about Y axis, rotation about Z axis)
    float64[36] covariance

Abstract
========
This REP updates the specification of the ROS distribution files facilitated in
the building, packaging, testing and documenting process.

The intention is to separate the buildfarm related configuration options from
the information describing the ROS packages and repositories [1]_ [2]_.

This REP is a revised version of REP 141 [3]_.
It currently does not repeat the content of REP 141 but only states the
differences.


Specification
=============

Index file
----------

* distributions

  * distribution: list of reference to the distribution files
    A single distribution file guarantees that there are no duplicate
    repositories.
    But when running a custom buildfarm which only adds custom repositories it
    is much smoother to maintain them in a separate file to avoid any kind of
    conflicts.
    It also allows to override specific repositories with either a forked
    variant or a specific version number.

  * release_builds / source_builds / doc_builds: are being removed since they
    only contain information relevant to the buildfarm

* version: version number, this REP describes version 3 (instead of version 2
  described in REP 141 [3]_ and version 1 described in REP 137 [4]_)


Distribution file
-----------------

* repositories

  * source

    * test_commits: a boolean flag used to enable CI jobs for each commit to
      the branch specified under ``versions``. (default: false)
    * test_pull_requests: a boolean flag used to enable CI jobs for each pull
      request against the branch specified under ``versions``. (default: false)
    * version: if ``test_pull_requests`` is enabled the version must specify a
      branch.

* version: version number, this REP describes version 2 (instead of version 1
  described in REP 141 [3]_ and REP 137 [4]_)


Reference implementation
------------------------
This REP is to be implemented in version 0.4 of the Python package *rosdistro*.
It will serve as a reference implementation for this REP.
A draft implementation can be found in the "rep143" branch of
[ros-infrastructure/rosdistro](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdistro/tree/rep143).

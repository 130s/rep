reStructuredText for REPs
=========================

This is a direct search-and-replace port of the Python REP
scripts at:

http://svn.python.org/projects/reps/trunk/

Original (modified) README.txt follows:

Original REP source may be written using two standard formats, a
mildly idiomatic plaintext format and the reStructuredText format
(also, technically plaintext).  These two formats are described in REP
9 and REP 12 respectively.  The rep2html.py processing and
installation script knows how to produce the HTML for either REP
format.  A local copy of the Docutils package is included for
processing reStructuredText REPs.

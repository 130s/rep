Abstract
========

This REP outlines compatibility defintions for TurtleBot compatible
platforms. The TurtleBot is a specific product, but it is an Open
Hardware Design TODO LINK.  The purpose of this document is to
differentiate the critical design features which are necessary for
compatability from the other design features which can be modified
without functionally effecting the core design.


Motivation
==========

Developers of TurtleBot applications, hardware accessories, models,
and libraries need a share convention for compatibility in order to
better integrate and re-use software and hardware components. Shared
conventions for compatibility provides a specification for developers
creating new hardware configurations, and accessories for TurtleBot
compatible platforms. Similarly, developers creating libraries and
applications can more easily use their software with robots that are
compatible with this specification.  

It is expected that most tools and applications written for a
TurtleBot should run on a Level 1 compatible robot.

There are a lot of tools and applications written for the TurtleBot
which can be useful for other similar robots.  Level 2 compatible
robots are a subset of these robots for which a significant subset
will work.  There are already a number of robots which are close such
as Mini Max [#minimax]_ and Pi Robot [#pirobot]_ .

Simulation
==========

And there is a package which provides the necessary Gazebo model for
Level 1 compliant robots.  See the turtlebot_simulator stack
[#turtlebot_simulator]_ for more information.

It is recommended for Level 2 compliant robots to release a stack with
the gazebo model(s) which allows them to be simulated as well, to ease
development for developers who do not always have access to hardware.

Existing REP Compliance
=======================

This REP is built upon previous REPs and ROS best practices. All implementations should do the same.  Specifically relevant ones are listed below.  

REP 103 [#REP-103]_ Standard Units of Measure and Coordinate Conventions 
    All units will follow REP 103 and all cooridnate frames will follow the conventions in REP 103. 

REP 105 [#REP-105]_ Coordinate Frames for Mobile Platforms 
    The coordinate frames for the mobile base will follow REP 105. 

REP 107 [#REP-107]_ Diagnostic System for Robots Running ROS
    All hardware drivers should provide diagnostic information via the diagnostic_msgs interface of REP 107.

Compatibility Specification
===========================

There are two levels of compatability defined in this REP.  Level 1
compatable robots are expected to be able to be swapped out without
significant code changes. Level 2 compatable robots are expected to be
able to share significant software components, but may require
non-trivial changes to software between robots.

Below are the specifications for each of the levels of compliance:

Level 1
-------

Robots that are level 1 compatible meet the following requirements as well as all Level 2 requirements.  


Hardware Requirements
'''''''''''''''''''''
The following hardware requirements are to ensure that the default
TurtleBot software runs without modification on the robot and to
ensure accessory compatibility between TurtleBot compatible robots. 

* The robot must have a rgbd camera with a base_link to
  camera_rgb_frame translation of [x:-0.087m, y:-0.005m, z:0.287m], as
  specified in the turtlebot.xacro file in the turtlebot_description
  package. 
* The top mounting surface of the robot must provide a hole grid pattern
  centered around the z-axis of the robot base_link that is identical to
  the 68-04541_TurtleBot_Plate_2 part found in the TurtleBot hardware
  documentation. #### TODO DESCRIBE IN THIS DOCUMENT 
* The top mounting surface of the robot must be 0.2032m (8 inches)
  from rgbd camera mounting surface.
* The base footprint is circular with diameter ######
 
Software Requirements
'''''''''''''''''''''
The TurtleBot stacks (turtlebot_viz, turtlebot_apps, and  turtlebot_arm)
must run on the robot without user modification. 

Distributors of TurtleBot Level 1 compatible robots should provide the 
following software and configuration files if they are different than the 
TurtleBot:

* A node which implements the turtlebot_node ROS API [#turtlebot_node]_
* Provide equivilant diagnostics with turtlebot_node [#turtlebot_node]_
* Provide turtlebot.launch file to replace turtlebot_bringup/upstart/turtlebot.launch

* If the RGBD sensor requires a breaker to turn on it will use "Breaker 0"
* If an attached arm requires a breaker to turn on it will use "Breaker 1"  TODO Better define



Level 2
-------

Hardware Requirements
'''''''''''''''''''''

* An RGBD sensor
* A mobile robot base
* A computer capable of running ROS and processing the RGBD sensor.  

Software Requiremets
''''''''''''''''''''
* URDF description of the robot
* The origin of the base_link is at the center of the base footprint. 
* The depth sensor should publish in the "camera" namespace
* The base moves based on "geometry_msgs/Twist" on the topic "cmd_vel"
* The base publishes "nav_msgs/Odometry" on "odom"
* REP 105 [#REP-105]_ compliant



Hardware Extensions and Modifications
-------------------------------------

When adding or creating new hardware for TurtleBot compliant robots
distributors should use the following guidelines and conventions:

Sensor Naming Convetions
''''''''''''''''''''''''

 * 

Link and Joint Naming Conventions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The naming conventions for link names are designed to 

URDF
''''


Exceptions
----------

The scope of potential robotics software is too broad to require all
ROS software to follow the guidelines of this REP.  However, choosing
different conventions should be well justified and well documented.



Compliance
==========

This REP depends on and is compliant with REP 103 [#REP-103]_ , REP 105 [#REP-105]_,
and REP 107 [#REP-107]_.
